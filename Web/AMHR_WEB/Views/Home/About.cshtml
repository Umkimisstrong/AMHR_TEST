It's also worth noting that just about any HTML can go within the <code>.accordion-body</code>, though the transition does limit overflow.

                Since it is generally made using high-alcohol alcohol, it has very good preservation properties. <br />
                It has advantages over preservation methods such as jam or pickles. <br />
            </p>
            <p class="lead">

                The first is that it almost has no expiration date. <br />
                Second, if you boil it to make jam, the scent will disappear (like mulberries or watermelon...), but the scent of the ingredients is captured well without boiling them. <br />
                Thirdly, it can dissolve fats that do not dissolve well in water. A representative example of the strengths of ethanol, an organic solvent, is Amaretto.
                In addition, ethanol denatures proteins, neutralizes poisons or kills bacteria, and eliminates fishy smells.<br />
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                For this reason, it sometimes contains items that would never be eaten raw, such as snakes or wasps, and furthermore, it is the only way to consume these items.<br />
                Of course, safety is not guaranteed.    In Korea, alcohol made using soju is well known.<br />
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Although it has the same meaning as leach liquor, it is used somewhat differently as leach liquor is usually made at home, while leach liquor is made as a finished product in a factory.<br />
                Considering the manufacturing method of soaking ingredients in alcohol to extract their scent and medicinal properties, some of Korea's soaking liquors can be considered liquors by world standards.<br />

            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                However, the strict definition of liquors requires that sugar be added, so not all soaking liquors are liquors.<br />
                Sugar is sometimes added to enhance preservation, and in this case, it can be viewed as a liquor.<br />
                Among various famous liquors, there are many products made in a similar way to soaking liquor, Especially herbal liqours.
